schema: 1 # currently only version 1 is supported. All schema versions are going to be backward compatible unless otherwise noted. We plan to support decrepated versions for atleast six months
type: normalize # valid types are normalize,general-context,policy-context and resource-context

vendor-id: foo-cloud-cspm-vendor # this identifies the vendor that generated the alert
id: foo-cloud-normalize # this is the id of this workflow. If you change the id, the new id will represent a new workflow

filters: # before this workflow can run, Dassana engine will match the input to see if it passes the filters.
  - match-type: all # valid values are all or any
    rules: # these are JQ expressions which must return either true or false

#this workflow being a demo workflow doesn't have steps. In general, you will have steps that take the input and output something meaningful
#for example, refer to https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/blob/main/content/workflows/vendors/security-hub/aws-config.yaml

# the output of this workflow is sent to general-context, resource-context and policy-context workflows
# note that each array represents a JSON key

#here is a sample JSON object which is generated by this workflow

# {
# 	"csp": "demo-csp",
# 	"resourceId": "demo-resoureceId",
# 	"canonicalId": "demo-canonicalId",
# 	"service": "demo-service",
# 	"vendorPolicy": "depo-vendorPolicy",
# 	"vendorId": "foo-cloud",
# 	"alertId": "demo-alert-id",
# 	"resourceContainer": "demo-resourceContainer",
# 	"region": "demo-region",
# 	"resourceType": "demo-resourceType"
# }

output:
  - name: vendorId
    value: foo-cloud-cspm-vendor
    value-type: STRING # the field value-type is optional with the default value of JQ. This is a demo workflow so we are not extracting anyting from steps using jq, so we are using STRING which simply puts the value in the JSON key
